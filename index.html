    <p>hello! if you're reading this you're alive!(daft punk reference)</p>
        <h1 style="color: red; font size: 40px;">A timeless masterpiece</h1>
        <p>Random access memories turned <strong>10 years ago</strong> back in 2013 and has grown</p>
        <p>to become one of the duos most perfect projects of all time.</p>
        <p>this was the duos last album and man, what a way to go!</p>
        <p>this album most importantly a celebration of music</p>
        <p>and the love they have for specifically the music that inspired them</p>
        <p>it feels like a throwback to that era of funk, electro and dance music</p>
        <p>it feels very theatrical and grand while at the time there were many artist</p>
        <p><em>i honestly think, I don't think I've ever had a listening experience</p>
    <p>that comes remotely close to equal to the one that is brought by daft punk</em></p>
     <p>in their R.A.M. album. what's really amazing is that it's <em>rammed</em> full of hooks,</p>
     <p>But it doesnt sacrifice the sound they didnt focus on one more than the other both</p>
     <p>were crucial so it could work. with <strong>"Lose Yourself To Dance"</strong> being my personal favorite.</p>

        <h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 30px;">What did people think of it when it came out?</h1>
        <p>people at the time still loved it, it was one of the most anticipated releases of the year and when it arrived</p>
     <p>it was weird, people were split on it, you either seemed to love it or hate it</p>
     <p>roughly equal proportions. its Lead single "Get Lucky" was a massive hit.</p>
     <p>and the album has been at Number 1 in the charts almost everywhere in the world when it camed output</p>
     many people today still discuss the meaning of each song, and the thing is that its totally up for the reader
     or in this case listner to interpert, my personal meaning for "game of love" is here <a href="page2.html">page2</a>
